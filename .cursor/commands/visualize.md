# /visualize: Diagrams & Flows

Create diagrams only if they simplify understanding by at least 50%.

## 1. Validate Need
- Ask if a text explanation would work better first.
- Ensure the diagram helps understanding rather than just "looking pretty".

## 2. Simple Mermaid
- Use flowcharts for basic flows and sequenceDiagrams for interactions.
- Max 10-12 nodes; descriptive labels that explain business purpose.
